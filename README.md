# A shapelet-based framework for large-scale word-level sign language database auto-construction

## openpose

This module gives how to use the [openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose.git) module to extract the key points of body and hands from videos.

The source code mainly refers to the project [pytorch-openpose](https://github.com/Hzzone/pytorch-openpose.git). And the trained model of hand and body can be download with the following links (extraction code: **spbs**):

- [hand](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aFSq6cUJe86nryNKZWe9_A)

And the final extracted motion data can be downloaded as:  [motiondata](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Wasx80P61C_02j8gBh7Zgg)--(code:**spbs**)

## samples

This module gives the source code of sample augmentation, target identification and test sample generationã€‚

## shapelets

This module gives the source code of the two proposed learning methods, and the final learned shapelets can be downloaded with the [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hagky7TvDjki8NYCQ8b0lQ).


## Update

The model data and test code of the whole project are continuously updating ......
